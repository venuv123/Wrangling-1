## Project 4 - Data Wrangling

The dataset that I had worked for wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog.
These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

**My goal:** 
Wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. 
The Twitter archive is great, but it only contains very basic tweet information. Additional gathering, then assessing and cleaning is
required for "Wow!"-worthy analyses and visualizations.

**Output:** 
The output files are shown in the above files shared with all the visuals and major insights.
